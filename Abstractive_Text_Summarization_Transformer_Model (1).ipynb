Although some early Sanskrit literature mentions the name Vanga, the region\\'s early history is obscure.[31]In 1947, at the end of British rule over the Indian subcontinent the Bengal Legislative Council and the Bengal Legislative Assembly voted on the Partition of Bengal along religious lines into two separate entities: West Bengal, which continued as an Indian state and East Bengal, a province of Pakistan, which came to be known be as East Pakistan and later became the independent Bangladesh.[11][32]In 2011 the Government of West Bengal proposed a change in the official name of the state to Paschim Banga (Bengali: পশ্চিমবঙ্গ Pôshchimbônggô).[33] This is the native name of the state, literally meaning \"western Bengal\" in the native Bengali language. In August 2016 the West Bengal Legislative Assembly passed another resolution to change the name of West Bengal to \"Bengal\" in English and \"Bangla\" in Bengali. Despite the Trinamool Congress government\\'s efforts to forge a consensus on the name change resolution, the Indian National Congress, the Left Front and the Bharatiya Janata Party opposed the resolution.[34] However, the central government has turned down the proposal maintaining the state should have one single name for all languages instead of three and it should not be the same as that of any other territory (pointing out that the name \\'Bangla\\' may create confusion with neighbouring Bangladesh).[34][35][36]'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":7}],"source":["t5_input_text2"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":37,"status":"ok","timestamp":1710315719283,"user":{"displayName":"Jyotirmoy Banerjee","userId":"03510061476951486101"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"QUIY1EQVop_b"},"outputs":[],"source":["## preprocess the input text\n","preprocessed_text = text.strip().replace('\\n','')\n","t5_input_text = 'summarize: ' + preprocessed_text"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":308},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":39,"status":"ok","timestamp":1710315719285,"user":{"displayName":"Jyotirmoy Banerjee","userId":"03510061476951486101"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"cgCbmSLbpXgr","outputId":"5a7c1bf6-1628-4ec7-e148-7b73d291370a"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'summarize: Back in the 1950s, the fathers of the field, Minsky and McCarthy, described artificial intelligence as any task performed by a machine that would have previously been considered to require human intelligence.That\\'s obviously a fairly broad definition, which is why you will sometimes see arguments over whether something is truly AI or not.Modern definitions of what it means to create intelligence are more specific. Francois Chollet, an AI researcher at Google and creator of the machine-learning software library Keras, has said intelligence is tied to a system\\'s ability to adapt and improvise in a new environment, to generalise its knowledge and apply it to unfamiliar scenarios.\"Intelligence is the efficiency with which you acquire new skills at tasks you didn\\'t previously prepare for,\" he said.\"Intelligence is not skill itself; it\\'s not what you can do; it\\'s how well and how efficiently you can learn new things.\"It\\'s a definition under which modern AI-powered systems, such as virtual assistants, would be characterised as having demonstrated \\'narrow AI\\', the ability to generalise their training when carrying out a limited set of tasks, such as speech recognition or computer vision.Typically, AI systems demonstrate at least some of the following behaviours associated with human intelligence: planning, learning, reasoning, problem-solving, knowledge representation, perception, motion, and manipulation and, to a lesser extent, social intelligence and creativity.AlexNet\\'s performance demonstrated the power of learning systems based on neural networks, a model for machine learning that had existed for decades but that was finally realising its potential due to refinements to architecture and leaps in parallel processing power made possible by Moore\\'s Law. The prowess of machine-learning systems at carrying out computer vision also hit the headlines that year, with Google training a system to recognise an internet favorite: pictures of cats.The next demonstration of the efficacy of machine-learning systems that caught the public\\'s attention was the 2016 triumph of the Google DeepMind AlphaGo AI over a human grandmaster in Go, an ancient Chinese game whose complexity stumped computers for decades. Go has about possible 200 moves per turn compared to about 20 in Chess. Over the course of a game of Go, there are so many possible moves that are searching through each of them in advance to identify the best play is too costly from a computational point of view. Instead, AlphaGo was trained how to play the game by taking moves played by human experts in 30 million Go games and feeding them into deep-learning neural networks.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}],"source":["t5_input_text"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":38,"status":"ok","timestamp":1710315719286,"user":{"displayName":"Jyotirmoy Banerjee","userId":"03510061476951486101"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"zGllXQ_4m1bD","outputId":"26eeebd0-8f3f-4a0a-d743-7f8a5fba454e"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["1065"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":10}],"source":["len(t5_input_text2.split())"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":35,"status":"ok","timestamp":1710315719286,"user":{"displayName":"Jyotirmoy Banerjee","userId":"03510061476951486101"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"ogRtl7PZpC3m","outputId":"7a5a7144-fbb4-4a2a-d97b-5e0ec44b864f"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["410"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":11}],"source":["len(t5_input_text.split())"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":33,"status":"ok","timestamp":1710315719287,"user":{"displayName":"Jyotirmoy Banerjee","userId":"03510061476951486101"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"2U7UX-JWnLOa","outputId":"a950b0e3-0a81-4d60-a24b-22934a55df98"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length.
